### Using statebins package ###
###############################

# Sometimes you want to produce a map of U.S. states
# but you don't want the size of the states to influence
# the viewer's takeaways; you want the focus on the 
# plotted values instead. 
# That's where state bins come into play, as each
# state is afforded an equal sized bin and they are 
# generally located where they are geographically.

# Importantly, when using the statebins package, there
# are two ways it can be used. 1) You can use the statebins()
# function in lieu of ggplot (there are some departures from
# ggplot's structure), or 2) You can use ggplot and the 
# geom_statebins() layer. Both are illustrated below.


### Importing and prepping state-level data ###

# In the example used in class, we brought in the State_LBW data
# in the state_data folder on github. This data is ugly -- multiple
# years for each state; includes city and territory in addition to 
# states, etc. Here's how we sysematically prepped (filtered) the
# data so that we ended up with just 50 states, just percent values, 
# and just 2020 data.

StateLBW <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SOCatCC/DAV/main/Data/state_data/StateLBW.csv")

View(StateLBW)
glimpse(StateLBW)

statelbwsmall <- StateLBW %>%
  filter(LocationType == "State" & TimeFrame == 2020 & DataFormat == "Percent")

glimpse(statelbwsmall)

View(statelbwsmall)


# We still need to clone the Data column and convert it to a whole
# % numeric value in the process. 

statelbwsmall <- statelbwsmall %>%
	mutate(plbw = as.numeric(Data)*100)

View(statelbwsmall)

# Our data are now ready to go. 


### Option 1 -- Using the statebins function ###

statebins(state_data = statelbwsmall,
	state_col = "Location",
	value_col = "plbw",
	font_size = 3) +
	scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "cividis") +
	labs(title = "something something",
		caption = "Data Source: Kids Count") +
	theme_statebins(legend_position = "bottom")

# The code above is a bit different from ggplot but not a lot.
# It also produces nicely squared bins.


### Option 2 -- Using ggplot and geom_statebins() ###

# This is more familiar code for us.

ggplot(data = statelbwsmall, aes(state = Location, fill = plbw)) +
  geom_statebins() +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "cividis") +
  labs(title = "State bins with ggplot2", 
       caption = "Data Source: Kids Count", 
       fill = "% LBW") +
  theme_void()
