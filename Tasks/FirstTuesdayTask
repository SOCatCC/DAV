Create an RMarkdown file in your sandbox project, using it to generate a html document with an analysis of the EPneighborhood data (github). 
Specifically, generate a plot of the association between poverty rate (ppov) and mortality rate (mortrate). 
Provide commentary of each stage and include the code in your html document.

Break down how we’re going to accomplish this:
1.
2.
….

Overcome any unexpected challenges (if there are any). Googling about the error often provides a way forward.

Now add an analysis of the mining data to your html. 
Specifically, generate a visual comparing the distribution of counties on % reporting only poor/fair health (pfairpoor) 
by counties’ mining status (minestat or minestatc). Use minestatc in your first visual. Then try minestat in a second visual. 
Troubleshoot as needed.
